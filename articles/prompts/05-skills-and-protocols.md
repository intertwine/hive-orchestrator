## Image 1: Hero Image - The Onboarding Problem

**Prompt:**
Create an image of a new AI robot on its first day at work, standing at the entrance of a complex workspace filled with tools, protocols, and documentation. The robot has a fresh, uncertain expression, wearing a virtual "NEW" badge. Around it, experienced robots are working efficiently with various tools and following clear pathways. The new robot is surrounded by floating question marks and exclamation points representing uncertainty. A helpful mentor robot approaches with a glowing "SKILL MODULE" in its hands, ready to transfer knowledge. The atmosphere is welcoming but complex—lots to learn but help is available. Warm workplace illustration style, first-day-at-work energy, hopeful tone.

**Caption:** *Every session starts fresh—agents don't remember yesterday's onboarding. Skills and protocols provide instant orientation for effective work.*

## Image 2: Skills as Knowledge Modules

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing five glowing skill modules floating in a circular display, like collectible gems or power-ups in a video game. Each module has a distinct icon and color: "PROJECT MANAGEMENT" (clipboard icon, blue), "CORTEX OPERATIONS" (gear/brain icon, purple), "DEEP WORK SESSION" (focus target icon, gold), "MULTI-AGENT COORDINATION" (network icon, green), "MCP TOOLS" (plug/connection icon, orange). A robot reaches toward one module which expands to reveal detailed instructions inside, while the others remain compact. The aesthetic is clean and game-like, suggesting collectible abilities that enhance the agent's capabilities. Modern UI/game design hybrid style, satisfying visual hierarchy, glowing effects.

**Caption:** *Skills are modular instruction sets—only loaded when needed. Five built-in skills cover project management, Cortex CLI, deep work, coordination, and MCP tools.*

## Image 3: The Deep Work Lifecycle

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing the Deep Work session lifecycle as a circular journey with five distinct waypoints. Starting from the top and moving clockwise: 1) "ENTER" (robot arriving through a portal, reading orientation materials), 2) "CLAIM" (robot placing its badge on a project, ownership lock engaging), 3) "WORK" (robot intensely focused at workstation, tasks being completed), 4) "UPDATE" (robot writing notes that float up and merge with a document), 5) "HANDOFF" (robot passing a completion package through an exit portal, status resetting). The center shows the AGENCY.md document that connects all phases. Journey map illustration style, clear directional flow, warm productive colors, sense of purposeful cycle.

**Caption:** *The Deep Work lifecycle: Enter → Claim → Work → Update → Handoff. A complete cycle ensures clean state for the next session.*

## Image 4: The Ownership Protocol Ceremony

**Prompt:**
Create an image depicting ownership as a formal ceremonial exchange. A robot approaches a pedestal where a glowing "PROJECT TOKEN" hovers. The robot performs a ritual gesture—scanning, verifying, confirming ownership is null—before the token transforms and bonds to the robot with a visible "OWNER: [agent-name]" label appearing. Other robots wait respectfully at designated waiting areas, observing the protocol. The atmosphere is like a formal key exchange or badge ceremony—serious, orderly, respected. When the owner-robot is ready to leave, another pedestal shows the release ceremony with the token floating free again. Ceremonial illustration style, dignified and orderly, emphasizing the sacredness of the ownership protocol.

**Caption:** *Ownership protocol is sacred: verify availability, claim formally, work with commitment, release properly. Only one owner at a time.*

## Image 5: Blocking Protocol

**Prompt:**
Create an image of a robot encountering an immovable obstacle in its work path—a giant red barrier or wall. Instead of futilely trying to push through, the robot calmly activates a "BLOCKED" beacon above its head that sends a signal upward into the sky. The beacon creates a holographic message bubble that displays a clear blocking reason: "NEED DATABASE CREDENTIALS". The robot then sets down its tools in an orderly fashion and exits through a side path, leaving the project clearly marked for human intervention. A small human figure is visible in the distance, receiving the blocked signal notification. Professional problem-escalation illustration, calm acceptance of limitations, red/amber warning colors combined with professional demeanor.

**Caption:** *When blocked by external dependencies, don't struggle—set blocked status, document the reason clearly, and signal for help. Visibility over silence.*

## Image 6: Communication Through Notes

**Prompt:**
Create an image of a shared workspace wall covered with organized sticky notes arranged in chronological timeline fashion. Each note has a clear agent avatar icon, timestamp, and message. Different note colors indicate different message types: blue for "@MENTIONS", red for "BLOCKED" alerts, green for "DECISIONS", yellow for "TODO" items, purple for "CONTEXT". Robots of different designs are reading and contributing notes—one robot finds a note addressed to it with its name highlighted, another robot adds a decision note explaining an architectural choice. The wall serves as a living communication hub. Collaborative workspace illustration, organized information architecture, warm and productive atmosphere.

**Caption:** *Agent Notes are the communication channel: timestamped, attributed, and persistent. @mentions for specific agents, DECISION for choices, BLOCKED for obstacles.*

## Image 7: MCP Tools in Action

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing a robot at a futuristic control console with MCP tools visualized as sleek, labeled control buttons and levers. The console displays tool names: "list_projects" (list icon), "get_ready_work" (checkmark icon), "claim_project" (lock icon), "add_note" (pencil icon), "release_project" (unlock icon). The robot activates the "get_ready_work" control, and a holographic response appears showing available projects. Data flows visually between the console and the Agent Hive system in the background. The aesthetic is clean sci-fi control room, emphasizing programmatic access as intuitive control interface. Technical illustration style, API/console aesthetic, satisfying cause-and-effect visualization.

**Caption:** *MCP tools enable programmatic interaction: list projects, find ready work, claim, update status, add notes, release—all without manual file editing.*

## Image 8: Why Protocols Matter

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing a before/after split-screen of agent coordination. Left side "WITHOUT PROTOCOLS": chaotic scene with robots bumping into each other, conflicting work, confused expressions, tangled communication lines, files in disarray, overlapping claims. Right side "WITH PROTOCOLS": orderly scene with robots following clear pathways, smooth handoffs, organized workspace, clear communication channels, visible status indicators, harmonious collaboration. A central dividing line is styled as a "PROTOCOL RULEBOOK" that transforms chaos into order. The visual emphasizes that protocols aren't bureaucracy—they're the foundation of coordination. Before/after transformation illustration, dramatic contrast, professional and educational.

**Caption:** *Protocols aren't bureaucracy—they're the foundation that makes multi-agent coordination possible. Consistency, predictability, debuggability.*

## Generation Notes

**Style consistency:** Educational and professional illustration style. Show agents as learners who become capable through skills and protocols. Warm, encouraging colors for the teaching/onboarding aspects.

**Aspect ratios:**
- Hero image (1): 16:9 landscape for welcoming scene
- Skills display (2): Square 1:1 or 4:3 for clean module grid
- Lifecycle diagram (3): Square 1:1 for circular journey
- Ceremonial images (4, 5): 4:3 or 16:9 landscape for scene composition
- Communication/collaboration (6, 7): 16:9 landscape for workspace scenes
- Before/after (8): 16:9 landscape for dramatic split

**Visual metaphors:** Skills as power-up modules, ownership as formal ceremony, blocking as proper escalation, notes as shared memory wall.

**Quality modifiers:** high-quality, detailed illustration, clean professional aesthetic, educational and approachable, warm colors
