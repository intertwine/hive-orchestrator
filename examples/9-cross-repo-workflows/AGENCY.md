# Cross-Repository Improvement Example

## Objective

This is an example AGENCY.md for cross-repository workflows. Replace the `target_repo.url` with your actual target repository.

The goal is to demonstrate how Agent Hive coordinates work on external GitHub repositories using the standard file-based protocol.

## Tasks

- [ ] Analyze the target repository structure and identify patterns
- [ ] Determine a valuable improvement opportunity
- [ ] Implement the improvement and document changes
- [ ] Submit a pull request to the target repository

## Context

### About the Target Repository

Describe what the target repository does and why you want to improve it.

### Improvement Criteria

Good improvements are:
- **Atomic**: Can be completed in a single PR
- **Valuable**: Provides clear benefit to the project
- **Low Risk**: Unlikely to break existing functionality
- **Well-Scoped**: Not too broad or ambitious
