## Image 1: Hero Image - From Zero to Orchestration

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing a rocket launch pad preparation sequence, where the rocket represents an Agent Hive project ready for liftoff. A friendly robot technician stands at a control console, going through a startup checklist. The rocket has a hexagonal beehive pattern on its exterior and the Agent Hive logo. The launch pad is surrounded by the essential components floating as labeled icons: "Python 3.11+", "Git", "uv", "OpenRouter API". A progress bar at the bottom shows "READY FOR LAUNCH". The atmosphere is exciting but approachable—not intimidating, but aspirational. Retro space program poster aesthetic meets modern tech illustration, warm optimistic colors.

**Caption:** *From zero to orchestration: with a few prerequisites and simple setup, you're ready to launch your first Agent Hive project.*

## Image 2: Project Structure Overview

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing the Agent Hive file structure as an organized, well-lit storage facility or library. Different sections are clearly labeled: A "PROJECTS" wing shows a row of project folders each containing glowing AGENCY.md documents. A "SRC" wing shows code modules (cortex.py, dashboard.py, hive_mcp/) as distinct equipment stations. A "GLOBAL.md" file floats prominently as the central registry. A ".claude/skills/" section shows the skill modules on display. Small robot figures navigate the well-organized space easily, finding what they need. Clean architectural illustration style, organized and intuitive, satisfying spatial logic.

**Caption:** *The Agent Hive structure: projects in folders with AGENCY.md files, source code for engine and dashboard, skills for agent guidance, GLOBAL.md for system state.*

## Image 3: The Dashboard Interface

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing a sleek dashboard interface displayed on a large modern monitor at a comfortable workstation. The screen shows the Streamlit-based dashboard: a sidebar with project listings (some with status indicators), a main panel showing project details with visible task checkboxes, a "Generate Context" button glowing invitingly, and system status indicators showing the last Cortex run time. A human figure sits comfortably at the workstation, reviewing the dashboard with a satisfied expression. A robot assistant stands nearby, ready to claim work. Modern UI design illustration, clean dark mode interface, professional but welcoming.

**Caption:** *The Dashboard: view all projects, check statuses, generate Deep Work context for agents, and monitor system health—all from a friendly web interface.*

## Image 4: Creating Your First AGENCY.md

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing the creation of an AGENCY.md file as a crafting or blueprint-building activity. A robot carefully places components onto a glowing document template: a YAML frontmatter section at top with fields like "project_id", "status", "priority" visible as discrete labeled blocks being positioned. Below, the markdown content section shows an "Objective" heading and a task checklist being assembled. The workspace has a creative, maker-space feel—tools for building the perfect project file. A "CONFIG-SYSTEM" label floats above the work-in-progress. Crafting/maker illustration style, satisfying assembly process, warm workshop lighting.

**Caption:** *Creating your first project: craft an AGENCY.md file with YAML frontmatter for metadata and Markdown content for objectives, tasks, and notes.*

## Image 5: The Workflow in Action

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing the complete Agent Hive workflow as a flowing cycle diagram with illustrated stages. Stage 1: "CREATE PROJECT" (robot creating AGENCY.md). Stage 2: "GENERATE CONTEXT" (dashboard creating a context package). Stage 3: "CLAIM & WORK" (robot with context entering a work pod). Stage 4: "UPDATE & HANDOFF" (robot documenting work, releasing ownership). Stage 5: "CORTEX RUNS" (orchestrator analyzing and updating system state). Arrows connect all stages in a continuous cycle. The center shows the AGENCY.md as the persistent state that connects everything. Clean workflow diagram illustration, modern infographic style, clear directional flow.

**Caption:** *The workflow cycle: create projects, generate context, work and update, handoff cleanly, let Cortex orchestrate. Repeat for continuous progress.*

## Image 6: Adding Dependencies

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing the establishment of project dependencies as a construction or planning scenario. Two project buildings are being built: "CONFIG-SYSTEM" is partially complete with active construction. "API-SERVER" is in blueprint phase, waiting. A visible "blocked_by" beam connects them, showing that API-SERVER cannot start until CONFIG-SYSTEM finishes. A robot project manager reviews the dependency diagram on a tablet, nodding approvingly at the orderly sequence. When CONFIG-SYSTEM shows a "COMPLETED" badge, the blocking beam transforms into a green "READY" light for API-SERVER. Construction planning illustration style, clear cause-and-effect relationship, satisfying unlock moment.

**Caption:** *Adding dependencies: declare that API-SERVER is blocked by CONFIG-SYSTEM. When CONFIG-SYSTEM completes, API-SERVER unlocks and becomes ready.*

## Image 7: Quick Reference Poster

**Prompt:**
Create an image styled as a beautiful command-line reference poster or cheat sheet suitable for a developer's wall. The poster shows essential Agent Hive commands in clean typography: "make install" (setup), "make dashboard" (launch UI), "make ready" (find work), "make deps" (view dependencies), "make cortex" (run orchestrator). Each command has a small icon and brief description. The design is modern developer aesthetic—dark background with syntax-highlighted commands, clean sans-serif fonts, subtle grid layout. A small Agent Hive logo and bee icon in the corner. Developer cheat sheet / poster art style, functional and beautiful, something you'd want on your wall.

**Caption:** *Quick reference: the essential commands for daily Agent Hive operation. Install, dashboard, find work, view dependencies, run Cortex.*

## Generation Notes

**Style consistency:** Welcoming, approachable tutorial aesthetic. The imagery should feel like a friendly guide, not intimidating documentation. Combine technical precision with warm, inviting illustration.

**Aspect ratios:**
- Hero image (1): 16:9 landscape for aspirational opener
- Structure overview (2): 4:3 or 16:9 for architectural clarity
- Dashboard mockup (3): 16:9 landscape for screen aspect
- Creation activity (4): 4:3 or square for focused workspace
- Workflow diagram (5): Square 1:1 or 4:3 for cycle clarity
- Dependencies (6): 16:9 landscape for relationship illustration
- Reference poster (7): Portrait 3:4 or 2:3 for poster format

**Color palette:** Warm, welcoming colors. Use honey-gold Agent Hive branding accents throughout.

**Quality modifiers:** high-quality, detailed illustration, welcoming and approachable, clean modern aesthetic, tutorial-friendly
