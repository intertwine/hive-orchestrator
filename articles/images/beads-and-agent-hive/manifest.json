On the right path, the environment transforms into a warm document-based world—floating markdown pages like leaves, a cozy library atmosphere with glowing YAML files as lanterns, and a friendly bee mascot character. Both paths originate from a shared problem at the center: a confused robot with a question mark above its head standing at the fork. Dreamlike fantasy illustration style with soft gradients, warm lighting, storybook quality.\n\nGeneration Notes:\n**Style consistency:** Maintain warm, approachable illustration style.
