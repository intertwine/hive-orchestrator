## Image 1: Hero Image - Two Approaches Diverging

**Prompt:**
Create an image of a forking path in a stylized digital landscape. On the left path, the environment transforms into structured database architecture—crystalline data cubes, SQL tables floating like platforms, and a sleek Go mascot gopher character walking confidently. On the right path, the environment transforms into a warm document-based world—floating markdown pages like leaves, a cozy library atmosphere with glowing YAML files as lanterns, and a friendly bee mascot character. Both paths originate from a shared problem at the center: a confused robot with a question mark above its head standing at the fork. Dreamlike fantasy illustration style with soft gradients, warm lighting, storybook quality.

**Caption:** *Two valid approaches to the same problem: beads optimizes for query performance; Agent Hive optimizes for human readability.*

## Image 2: Agent Amnesia Visualization

**Prompt:**
Create an image of an AI robot sitting in a dimly lit room, surrounded by floating fragmented memories that are literally dissolving and breaking apart like shattered glass or melting ice. The fragments show partial code, half-completed project notes, and blurred diagrams. The robot has its hands pressed against its temples with a frustrated expression, as new memories form on one side but older ones crumble away on the other. A progress bar above the robot's head shows "CONTEXT: 95% FULL" in warning red. Emotional digital illustration style, melancholic blue and grey palette with warm accent colors for the dissolving memories, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting.

**Caption:** *"By phase 3 of 6, the AI has mostly forgotten where it came from." Agent amnesia isn't a bug—it's a structural limitation of context windows.*

## Image 3: The Database Approach (beads Architecture)

**Prompt:**
Create an architectural diagram illustration showing the beads system structure. At the bottom layer, show a Git repository icon as foundation. Above it, display JSONL files as structured data streams with flowing JSON objects. At the top layer, show a SQLite database icon with a lightning bolt indicating speed, connected to multiple query terminals. A cute gopher mascot (Go language) stands beside the structure holding a stopwatch showing "5ms". The style should be clean technical illustration with a dark mode aesthetic, using bright green, white, and grey color palette against a dark background. Isometric perspective, clean lines, developer-friendly aesthetic.

**Caption:** *beads treats agent memory as a database problem—JSONL for truth, SQLite for speed, Git for sync. Queries resolve in milliseconds.*

## Image 4: The Markdown Approach (Agent Hive Architecture)

**Prompt:**
Create an architectural diagram illustration showing the Agent Hive system structure. Show a simple, elegant file folder containing a single glowing AGENCY.md document as the centerpiece. The document is open, showing visible YAML frontmatter at top (rendered as a structured header card) and readable markdown content below (visible checkboxes, headings, notes). Multiple figures—robots and a human silhouette—are gathered around the document, each able to clearly read and understand it. A git commit history timeline flows beneath like a river of versions. Clean, warm illustration style with a light background, honey-gold and white color palette, emphasizing simplicity and accessibility.

**Caption:** *Agent Hive takes a different stance: one Markdown file per project. No databases, no binary formats—just human-readable text.*

## Image 5: Storage Philosophy Comparison

**Prompt:**
Create a split-screen comparison illustration. Left side: A dense, efficient data center visualization with stacked server racks, streaming data flows, and technical monitoring dashboards—representing machine-optimized storage with small text "OPTIMIZED FOR MACHINES". Right side: A cozy, well-lit reading room with the markdown document displayed on an elegant reading stand, a human figure comfortably reading from it, with a notebook and pen nearby—representing human-optimized storage with small text "OPTIMIZED FOR HUMANS". The dividing line between the two sides is a gradient blend. Modern illustration style, left side in cool tech blues and greens, right side in warm amber and cream tones.

**Caption:** *beads stores data optimally for machines; Agent Hive stores data readably for humans. Different optimizations for different values.*

## Image 6: Query Model Comparison

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing two contrasting query experiences side by side. Left: A developer at a terminal with rapid-fire queries flowing across multiple screens, instant results appearing in nanoseconds, represented by lightning bolt speed lines and a "0.005s" timer—the database query experience. Right: A developer calmly opening a file in a simple text editor, reading naturally like a book, with a thought bubble showing immediate understanding—the file-reading experience. Both developers look satisfied but in different ways—one thrilled by speed, one appreciating simplicity. Modern flat illustration style, clean composition, balanced colors.

**Caption:** *beads offers SQL-style queries at millisecond speed. Agent Hive offers reading files—no query language needed, just open and read.*

## Image 7: When to Use Which (Decision Flow)

**Prompt:**
Create an image of a friendly robot guide standing at an information kiosk in a futuristic transit station. The kiosk has two clearly marked departure platforms: Platform A labeled "beads" shows a high-speed train with database icons, marked for "Speed Priority, Claude/Claude Code, Complex Hierarchies". Platform B labeled "Agent Hive" shows a comfortable scenic train with markdown document icons, marked for "Transparency Priority, Multi-Vendor, Human Oversight". The robot guide holds a helpful sign reading "WHICH TRAIN?". Travelers (mix of robots and humans) are considering their options. Whimsical transit poster art style, retro-futuristic aesthetic, warm inviting colors.

**Caption:** *Not a competition—a choice based on priorities. Speed and queries? beads. Transparency and vendor freedom? Agent Hive. Need both? Use both.*

## Image 8: The Deeper Pattern

**Prompt:**
Create an image of traditional project management tools (Jira boards, GitHub Issues, Linear icons) shown as old-fashioned filing cabinets and physical bulletin boards in the background, slightly faded and dusty. In the foreground, glowing new structures emerge—beads as a crystalline database form on one side, Agent Hive as an organic hive structure on the other—both connected by a golden thread labeled "STRUCTURED AGENT MEMORY". AI robot figures work naturally with these new structures while the old tools recede. Transitional illustration style showing evolution, past in sepia tones, future in vibrant modern colors, forward-looking composition.

**Caption:** *Traditional tools were designed for humans with persistent memory. Agent infrastructure must work with agent limitations—discrete sessions, hard memory boundaries, fresh starts.*

## Generation Notes

**Style consistency:** Maintain warm, approachable illustration style. When comparing the two systems, use distinct but complementary visual languages—database/crystal/speed for beads, organic/warm/readable for Agent Hive.

**Aspect ratios:**
- Hero image (1): 16:9 landscape for article header
- Comparison images (5, 6): 16:9 to accommodate side-by-side layouts
- Architecture diagrams (3, 4): 4:3 or 1:1 square for technical clarity
- Conceptual images (2, 7, 8): 16:9 or 4:3 as fits content

**Quality modifiers:** high-quality, detailed illustration, clean composition, professional, modern aesthetic, approachable
