# Image Prompts: Dependency Graphs in Practice

*These prompts are designed for Google Gemini Imagen 3 / Nano Banana Pro model. Generate 6-8 images for the article.*

## Image 1: Hero Image - Why Dependencies Matter

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing the evolution of project management complexity across three scenes from left to right. Left: A single robot happily working on one floating project cube—simple and manageable. Center: Five project cubes connected by visible lines, a slightly stressed robot trying to track the connections with a tangled web of yarn and pins on a board behind it. Right: Fifty project cubes in an intricate 3D constellation with glowing dependency lines between them, an overwhelmed robot surrounded by chaos—but a glowing dashboard labeled "AGENT HIVE" emerges from below, untangling and organizing the connections into a clear graph. Progressive complexity narrative illustration, modern tech aesthetic, showing the journey from manageable to overwhelming to solved.

**Caption:** *One project needs no tracking. Five you can manage. Fifty? Implicit dependencies become a liability. Agent Hive makes relationships explicit and queryable.*

## Image 2: The Four Dependency Types

**Prompt:**
Create a visual legend or infographic showing four distinct dependency types as railway or transit connections between station icons. 1) "BLOCKED_BY" shown as a red stop signal—trains cannot proceed until the blocking station is cleared; 2) "BLOCKS" shown as a warning signal—trains downstream are waiting on this station; 3) "PARENT" shown as a nested structure—a small station contained within a larger terminal complex; 4) "RELATED" shown as a dotted informational line—connected for context but trains run independently. Each type has a clear icon, color coding, and brief label. Clean transit map aesthetic combined with tech infographic style, highly readable, organized layout, colorful but professional.

**Caption:** *Four dependency types for different relationships: blocked_by (must wait), blocks (others waiting), parent (hierarchy), related (context only).*

## Image 3: Ready Work Detection

**Prompt:**
Create an image of a smart traffic control center where an AI operator monitors a large display showing projects as vehicles at various traffic lights. Some vehicles (projects) are at green lights with clear roads ahead—these are highlighted with "READY" badges and pulled to the front. Other vehicles are stopped at red lights with visible blockers in front of them. The operator has a console showing a query "FIND READY WORK" with instant results populating. No LLM processing indicators—just pure graph traversal represented by a fast flow diagram. Clean technical illustration, traffic control room aesthetic, satisfying sense of organized flow, green highlighting for ready items.

**Caption:** *Finding ready work requires no LLM calls—just pure graph traversal. Projects with all blockers cleared light up as claimable.*

## Image 4: Cycle Detection

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing a circular trap or endless loop in a stylized project network. Three project nodes are connected in a triangle, each pointing to the next, creating an infinite loop visually represented as a glowing red circular arrow that pulses with warning energy. Small robot figures are stuck walking in the circle endlessly, unable to escape. A Cortex analyzer drone hovers above, projecting a warning hologram: "CYCLE DETECTED" with the loop clearly diagrammed. The rest of the network beyond the cycle is dimmed but visible, waiting. Dramatic technical illustration, warning red and amber colors, clear visual of the deadlock trap, urgent but informative tone.

**Caption:** *Circular dependencies are deadlocks that can never resolve. Each project waits for something that's waiting for it. Cortex detects these cycles automatically.*

## Image 5: Feature Development Pipeline

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing a linear factory assembly line or pipeline representing feature development stages. Five stations in sequence: "RESEARCH" (robot with magnifying glass studying documents), "DESIGN" (robot with blueprint hologram), "IMPLEMENT" (robot with code editor), "TEST" (robot with testing equipment and checkmarks), "DEPLOY" (robot with rocket launch controls). Products (feature containers) move along a conveyor between stations, each station clearly blocked until the previous one completes. The current active station is highlighted, previous ones show green completion checkmarks, future ones are dimmed waiting. Clean industrial/tech hybrid illustration, satisfying production line aesthetic, clear directional flow.

**Caption:** *A typical feature pipeline: research → design → implement → test → deploy. Each stage blocked by the previous, creating orderly progression.*

## Image 6: Platform Migration Diagram

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing a large-scale platform migration as an orchestrated aerial operation. At the top, a "MIGRATION PLANNING" command center coordinates three parallel flight paths below: "DATABASE MIGRATION" (data containers being airlifted), "API MIGRATION" (API endpoints being transported), "FRONTEND MIGRATION" (UI components in transit). All three paths converge at an "INTEGRATION TESTING" checkpoint where the components are assembled and verified together. Finally, everything proceeds to "CUTOVER" launch platform at the bottom. Glowing dependency lines show the parallel-then-converge pattern. Epic technical illustration, aerospace/logistics aesthetic, showing complex coordination as elegant orchestration.

**Caption:** *Platform migration: planning unlocks three parallel workstreams, integration testing waits for all three, then cutover can proceed. Complex coordination made visible.*

## Image 7: Dependency Best Practices

**Prompt:**
Create an image styled as a vintage "best practices" safety poster you might see in a factory, but for dependency management. A friendly instructor robot points to a chalkboard or poster showing six illustrated rules: 1) "BE EXPLICIT" (clear labeled arrows), 2) "MINIMIZE DEPS" (fewer is better—cluttered vs clean comparison), 3) "USE RELATED FOR CONTEXT" (dotted lines vs solid), 4) "CHECK FOR CYCLES EARLY" (circular warning sign), 5) "CONSISTENT GRANULARITY" (similar-sized blocks), 6) "UPDATE STATUS PROMPTLY" (clock with checkmark). Retro industrial safety poster aesthetic with modern content, warm instructional colors, friendly and memorable.

**Caption:** *Dependency management rules: be explicit, minimize dependencies, use related for context, watch for cycles, keep consistent granularity, update status promptly.*

## Image 8: The Full Dependency Graph View

**Prompt:**
Create an image of a stunning 3D holographic visualization of a complete project dependency network floating in a dark command center. The graph shows nodes of various sizes (representing project scope) connected by glowing edges of different colors (green for completed dependencies, amber for active, red for blocked, dotted white for related). Some nodes pulse with activity, others are dimmed as completed. A human operator and robot assistant observe the visualization together, with interactive controls floating nearby. Legend panel shows the color coding. The graph is complex but beautiful—organized chaos revealing hidden structure. Cinematic sci-fi visualization aesthetic, data is beautiful style, sense of mastery over complexity.

**Caption:** *The full dependency graph: every project, every relationship, every status—visible and queryable. Complexity becomes clarity.*

## Generation Notes

**Style consistency:** Technical but approachable illustrations. Dependency relationships should use consistent color coding throughout: green (completed/unblocked), amber (active/in-progress), red (blocked/error), dotted (related/informational).

**Aspect ratios:**
- Hero image (1): 16:9 landscape for progression narrative
- Infographic/legend (2): Square 1:1 or 4:3 for clean reference
- Technical diagrams (3, 4): 4:3 or 16:9 landscape
- Pipeline illustrations (5, 6): 16:9 landscape for horizontal/directional flow
- Best practices (7): Portrait 3:4 poster format
- Full visualization (8): 16:9 landscape for dramatic scope

**Visual metaphors:** Use consistent metaphors—traffic lights for blocking status, conveyor belts for pipelines, transit maps for dependency types.

**Quality modifiers:** high-quality, detailed, professional illustration, clear and readable, modern technical aesthetic
