# Image Prompts: Multi-Agent Coordination Without Chaos

*These prompts are designed for Google Gemini Imagen 3 / Nano Banana Pro model. Generate 6-8 images for the article.*

## Image 1: Hero Image - The Promise vs Reality

**Prompt:**
Create a dramatic split-image illustration. Top half: A beautiful vision of coordinated AI agents working in harmony—sleek robots at individual workstations in a futuristic open office, passing glowing data packages smoothly between each other, soft golden light, organized and serene, labeled subtly as "THE VISION". Bottom half: The same office in complete chaos—robots colliding at file cabinets, one robot holding a victory trophy while fires burn behind it, another robot spinning in circles with "404 NOT FOUND" errors orbiting its head, papers and code fragments scattered everywhere, harsh red warning lights, labeled subtly as "THE REALITY (WITHOUT COORDINATION)". Dramatic illustration style with strong contrast between halves.

**Caption:** *The promise: agents working in parallel, completing in hours what takes days. The reality without coordination: chaos, conflicts, and corrupted work.*

## Image 2: The Four Coordination Problems

**Prompt:**
Create a 2x2 grid illustration showing four distinct failure scenarios, each in its own panel with a clear icon/label. Panel 1 "RACE CONDITION": Two robots diving for the same glowing file, about to collide mid-air. Panel 2 "DEPENDENCY VIOLATION": A robot building a structure on a foundation that another robot is still constructing, the structure crumbling. Panel 3 "PREMATURE VICTORY": A robot planting a "DONE!" flag on a small mound while standing at the base of an enormous unfinished mountain. Panel 4 "COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN": Two robots facing away from each other, each holding contradicting plans, a broken link symbol between them. Clean iconographic style, consistent visual language, bold colors with warning orange/red accents, each panel clearly readable.

**Caption:** *Four ways multi-agent coordination fails: race conditions, dependency violations, premature victory declarations, and communication breakdowns.*

## Image 3: The Three Coordination Layers

**Prompt:**
Create a vertical layer cake diagram showing three distinct coordination mechanisms stacked on top of each other. Bottom layer (FOUNDATION): "Git-Based Coordination" shown as a solid bedrock foundation with git branch icons embedded, labeled "ALWAYS AVAILABLE - SLOW". Middle layer: "Cortex Orchestration" shown as an automated clockwork mechanism with gears, timing indicators showing "4 hours", labeled "SCHEDULED - OVERSIGHT". Top layer: "Real-Time Coordinator" shown as a lightning-fast switching hub with HTTP/API connections, timer showing "milliseconds", labeled "OPTIONAL - FAST". All three layers are connected by glowing conduits. Each layer has small robot figures using that layer appropriately. Technical illustration style, clean lines, blue gradient background, professional infographic aesthetic.

**Caption:** *Agent Hive provides three complementary coordination layers: git for foundation, Cortex for oversight, real-time coordinator for speed.*

## Image 4: The Ownership Protocol

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing the ownership claim process as a formal ceremony. A robot approaches a glowing project document on a pedestal. The document shows a "OWNER: NULL" field that transforms to "OWNER: claude-sonnet-4" as the robot places its hand on a scanner. A ceremonial seal of ownership appears above. Other robots wait respectfully at a distance behind a velvet rope, watching a status board showing which projects are claimed. The atmosphere is orderly and respectful, like a well-organized library or museum. Elegant illustration style, warm lighting, conveying the seriousness and mutual respect of the ownership protocol.

**Caption:** *The ownership protocol: explicitly claim before working, one owner at a time, release when done. Sacred rules that prevent coordination chaos.*

## Image 5: Sequential Handoff Pattern

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing a relay race between AI agents on a track. Three distinct robots representing different AI providers (one sleek, one robust, one elegant) are passing a glowing baton between them. The baton is labeled "CONTEXT" and leaves a trail of documented notes behind each runner. The track is marked with "RESEARCH" → "DESIGN" → "IMPLEMENTATION" lanes. The passing zones are highlighted with "AGENT NOTES" documentation floating above. Each runner is focused on their section. Dynamic sports illustration style combined with tech aesthetic, energetic composition, vibrant team colors, sense of motion and purpose.

**Caption:** *Sequential handoff: Claude researches, GPT-4 designs, Grok implements. Each leaves thorough notes for the next runner.*

## Image 6: Parallel Independence Pattern

**Prompt:**
Create an aerial view of three separate work pods floating in space, each containing a different AI robot working on an independent project. The pods are connected to a central coordinator hub by thin monitoring lines but are otherwise completely isolated from each other. Each pod has its own contained environment, tools, and project materials. The central hub shows a dashboard with three green status lights indicating all projects are proceeding without conflict. Small "NO COLLISION" shield icons float between the pods. Clean sci-fi illustration style, organized spatial composition, cool blue space background with warm lit interiors in each pod.

**Caption:** *Parallel independence: multiple agents working simultaneously on separate projects, with coordination preventing accidental overlap.*

## Image 7: Communication Through Agent Notes

**Prompt:**
Create an image of a message board or digital bulletin wall in a shared agent workspace. The wall shows multiple holographic sticky notes arranged chronologically, each clearly attributed to different agents with timestamps. Some notes are tagged with "@mentions", others with "DECISION:", "BLOCKED:", or "TODO:" prefixes that glow in different colors. Robots of different designs are reading the notes, adding new ones, and reacting to messages. One robot writes "Found issue in line 145 - implementing workaround" while another reads an earlier note about architectural decisions. Cozy collaborative workspace vibe, warm lighting, organized chaos of shared information, watercolor digital hybrid style.

**Caption:** *Since agents can't directly message each other, Agent Notes become the communication channel—timestamped, attributed, persistent.*

## Image 8: Human in the Loop

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing a human figure sitting at an elevated observation deck overlooking an orchestrated agent workspace below. The human has access to multiple monitoring screens showing git history, project statuses, and dependency graphs. Below, robots work industriously on their tasks. Key intervention points are highlighted—a human hand reaching down to break a circular deadlock between two stuck robots, another screen showing "BLOCKED: NEED HUMAN DECISION" with a pending approval button. The human appears calm, informed, and in control. The overall message is collaborative oversight, not micromanagement. Warm, reassuring illustration style, balanced composition showing both the productive agents and the attentive human overseer.

**Caption:** *Multi-agent coordination isn't about autonomous swarms. Humans define boundaries, review work, break deadlocks, and intervene when needed. Transparency makes this possible.*

## Generation Notes

**Style consistency:** Dynamic, energetic illustrations that convey both the potential chaos and the elegant solutions. Use consistent robot designs when representing the same agents across images.

**Aspect ratios:**
- Hero image (1): 16:9 landscape, dramatic split composition
- Coordination problems (2): Square 1:1 for clean 2x2 grid
- Layer diagram (3): Portrait 3:4 or 9:16 for vertical stack
- Process illustrations (4, 5): 16:9 landscape for horizontal flow
- Parallel/spatial images (6): 16:9 landscape for spatial relationships
- Communication and oversight (7, 8): 4:3 or 16:9

**Color coding:** Use consistent colors for coordination states—green for healthy/claimed, amber for pending/caution, red for blocked/conflict.

**Quality modifiers:** high-quality, detailed, professional illustration, dynamic composition, modern tech aesthetic
