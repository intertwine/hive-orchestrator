## Image 1: Hero Image - The Cambrian Explosion of Frameworks

**Prompt:**
Create an image depicting a vibrant "Cambrian explosion" of AI agent frameworks emerging from a primordial digital sea. Various distinct creature-like framework entities rise from the water: a graph-shaped entity labeled "LangGraph" with interconnected nodes as its body, a team of small collaborative creatures labeled "CrewAI", a conversational blob creature labeled "AutoGen" with chat bubbles, a minimal sleek entity labeled "OpenAI SDK", a code-generating insect labeled "smolagents", and a beehive structure labeled "Agent Hive". Each has its own unique design language but they're all part of the same evolutionary moment. Epic digital painting style, awe-inspiring biodiversity aesthetic, sense of emergence and possibility, beautiful and dramatic.

**Caption:** *2024-2025: A Cambrian explosion of agent frameworks. Each optimizes for different scenarios, embodies different philosophies. No single winner—an evolving ecosystem.*

## Image 2: Philosophy Comparison - Session vs Continuous

**Prompt:**
Create a split-image comparison. Left side "CONTINUOUS OPERATION": An AI agent robot connected to flowing streams of data, with glowing memory banks attached to its body, operating in a constant always-on state with a heartbeat monitor showing continuous activity. Right side "SESSION-ORIENTED": An AI robot in a clean pod that activates from cold start, reads a glowing document (AGENCY.md), works intensely for a bounded period, then powers down cleanly—with a clock showing discrete session windows. The two approaches face each other across a divide. Each is valid but fundamentally different. Conceptual comparison illustration, clean visual contrast, neither shown as superior, philosophical difference made tangible.

**Caption:** *Different operating philosophies: most frameworks assume continuous operation with in-memory state. Agent Hive assumes discrete sessions with durable file-based state.*

## Image 3: State Storage Comparison

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing different state storage approaches as different types of containers or warehouses. From left to right: A crystalline database structure (LangGraph's checkpoints), a vector-filled memory orb (CrewAI's ChromaDB), conversation bubbles floating in air (AutoGen's in-memory), a minimalist empty container with external storage arrows (OpenAI SDK's stateless), and finally a warm, glowing markdown document floating in clear glass (Agent Hive's human-readable files). Below each, a human figure tries to inspect the contents—most are opaque or require special tools, but the markdown document is clearly readable. State storage comparison illustration, varied visual metaphors, emphasis on transparency vs opacity.

**Caption:** *State storage philosophies: databases, vectors, in-memory objects, external requirements—or simple Markdown files anyone can read with a text editor.*

## Image 4: Multi-Agent Coordination Approaches

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing four different multi-agent coordination metaphors arranged in quadrants. Top-left "GRAPH EDGES": Robots moving along predefined railway tracks on a graph network. Top-right "CREW ROLES": Robots in distinct team uniforms (researcher, writer, analyst) working in a collaborative workspace. Bottom-left "CONVERSATIONS": Robots sitting in a circle having a natural language discussion with speech bubbles. Bottom-right "PROTOCOLS": Robots following formal protocols, checking status boards, claiming ownership badges, leaving documented notes. Each approach has merit; each fits different scenarios. Quadrant comparison illustration, distinct visual language per approach, no hierarchy implied, informative and balanced.

**Caption:** *How frameworks coordinate agents: graph edges (LangGraph), team roles (CrewAI), conversations (AutoGen), or explicit protocols (Agent Hive). Different tools for different problems.*

## Image 5: The Tradeoff Matrix Visualization

**Prompt:**
Create an image of a beautiful radar/spider chart visualization comparing six frameworks across multiple dimensions. The dimensions extend outward like spokes: "Learning Curve", "Human Readability", "Long-Horizon Support", "Vendor Independence", "Query Performance", "Multi-Agent". Each framework is represented by a colored polygon overlaid on the chart, with LangGraph strong in performance, CrewAI easy to learn, AutoGen enterprise-grade, smolagents minimal, Agent Hive strong in readability and long-horizon. A legend identifies each framework's color. The visualization is elegant and informative, like a beautiful data visualization poster. Modern data viz illustration, clean and professional, color-coded clarity.

**Caption:** *No framework wins everywhere. Each has strengths: LangGraph for power, CrewAI for intuition, AutoGen for enterprise, Agent Hive for transparency and long-horizon work.*

## Image 6: When to Use What - Decision Guide

**Prompt:**
Create an image styled as a friendly "choose your own adventure" or decision tree map. The starting point asks "WHAT DO YOU NEED?" and branches into different paths: "Complex real-time workflows" leads to LangGraph, "Rapid prototyping with teams" leads to CrewAI, "Enterprise reliability" leads to AutoGen, "Lightweight OpenAI" leads to OpenAI SDK, "Minimal code-first" leads to smolagents, "Multi-session human oversight" leads to Agent Hive. Each destination is represented by a distinct friendly landmark or building. The paths are clear but show that multiple valid routes exist. Illustrated map/adventure guide style, warm and inviting, helpful wayfinding aesthetic.

**Caption:** *Choosing the right framework depends on your needs. Complex workflows? LangGraph. Enterprise? AutoGen. Long-horizon with oversight? Agent Hive. All valid choices.*

## Image 7: Complementary Architecture

**Prompt:**
Create an architectural illustration showing Agent Hive as an orchestration layer with other frameworks operating within its structure. The top layer is labeled "AGENT HIVE - Long-horizon orchestration, human oversight, git state" as a broad platform or roof. Beneath it, three distinct project pods show different frameworks in action: one pod contains a LangGraph workflow diagram actively processing, another shows a CrewAI team collaborating, a third shows a smolagent writing code. All pods connect upward to Agent Hive through AGENCY.md documents that pass state between sessions. The message is clear: these aren't competitors but complementary layers. Architectural cross-section illustration, clear hierarchy showing coexistence, professional and harmonious.

**Caption:** *Complementary, not competitive: Agent Hive orchestrates between projects and across sessions. LangGraph, CrewAI, or smolagents can handle intra-session execution.*

## Image 8: The Right Abstraction Question

**Prompt:**
Create a philosophical, contemplative image showing the AI agent abstraction question as an elegant gallery or museum exhibit. Different rooms branch off from a central hall, each representing a different abstraction approach: a room of interconnected graphs, a room of team collaboration, a room of flowing conversations, a room of handoff gestures, a room of code execution, a room of glowing documents. In the center, a thoughtful figure (human or robot) stands at the crossroads, pondering which path resonates with their needs. The atmosphere is reflective and open—acknowledging that the field is young and no consensus exists yet. Contemplative gallery illustration, beautiful architectural spaces, philosophical and open-minded aesthetic.

**Caption:** *What's the right abstraction for agent systems? Graphs, teams, conversations, handoffs, code, or files? The field is too young for consensus—room for many approaches.*

## Generation Notes

**Style consistency:** Professional, balanced comparison illustrations. No framework should appear inferior—each has valid use cases. Use distinct visual languages for each framework but maintain overall cohesion.

**Framework visual identities:**
- LangGraph: Graph/network nodes, technical precision
- CrewAI: Team/crew aesthetics, collaborative warmth
- AutoGen: Enterprise/corporate professionalism
- OpenAI SDK: Minimal, sleek, simple
- smolagents: Code/minimal, insect/small metaphor
- Agent Hive: Beehive, honey-gold, documents, transparency

**Aspect ratios:**
- Hero image (1): 16:9 landscape for epic scene
- Philosophy comparison (2): 16:9 for split-screen
- Storage comparison (3): 16:9 for lineup comparison
- Quadrant coordination (4): Square 1:1 for clean quadrants
- Radar chart (5): Square 1:1 for data visualization
- Decision guide (6): 4:3 or 16:9 for map layout
- Architecture (7): 16:9 landscape for architectural clarity
- Gallery (8): 16:9 landscape for contemplative space

**Quality modifiers:** high-quality, detailed illustration, professional and balanced, modern aesthetic, informative and fair comparison
