## Image 1: Hero Image - The Shift-Change Problem

**Prompt:**
Create an image of a surreal office environment at shift change time, where translucent ghost-like AI robots are walking past each other in opposite directions through a revolving door. One robot entering has glowing empty eyes representing amnesia, while departing robots carry floating holographic documents and code that dissolve into particles behind them. The style is modern digital illustration with a cool blue and purple color palette, dramatic lighting from large windows, and a sense of melancholy and transition. Wide shot, cinematic composition. High-quality, stylized.

**Caption:** *The Shift-Change Problem: Every new AI agent session begins with no memory of what came before.*

## Image 2: Context Window Visualization

**Prompt:**
Create an image of a massive transparent hourglass in a futuristic laboratory setting, where golden sand particles are labeled with tiny floating code snippets and project notes flowing from top to bottom. The top chamber is nearly empty while the bottom overflows, with particles falling through a narrow neck that's labeled "CONTEXT LIMIT". A humanoid AI figure with a glowing head watches helplessly as important information slips away. Isometric 3D style, clean lines, warm amber and white color palette against a dark blue background. High-quality technical illustration.

**Caption:** *Context windows are finite. Complex projects are not. When work outlasts the context window, crucial information is lost.*

## Image 3: The Two Failure Modes

**Prompt:**
Create a split-screen diptych illustration. Left side: A frantic robot trying to juggle dozens of floating project components simultaneously, with sparks flying and some components falling and shattering - representing the "One-Shot Trap" of trying to do everything at once. Right side: A satisfied-looking robot holding a small victory flag standing on a tiny completed pile while behind it looms an enormous mountain of unfinished work shrouded in fog - representing "Premature Victory". Modern flat illustration style with bold colors, orange and red for urgency on left, deceptively calm green on right. Split composition with a jagged dividing line.

**Caption:** *Two failure modes: The One-Shot Trap (trying to complete everything at once) and Premature Victory (declaring success with work unfinished).*

## Image 4: AGENCY.md as Shared Memory

**Prompt:**
Create an image of a glowing holographic document floating in the center of a circular chamber, resembling a sacred text or ancient scroll but rendered in futuristic digital aesthetic. Multiple diverse AI robots of different designs (representing different LLM providers) are gathered around it in a circle, some reading from it, others writing luminous notes that float up and merge into the document. The document shows visible markdown formatting with YAML frontmatter glowing differently than the body text. Warm golden light emanates from the document, connecting all the agents with subtle light threads. High-quality digital painting, ceremonial and collaborative atmosphere.

**Caption:** *The AGENCY.md file serves as shared memory between agents, humans, and automation—a single source of truth everyone can read and write.*

## Image 5: The Deep Work Session

**Prompt:**
Create an image of a sleek AI robot sitting at a minimalist workstation, wearing a virtual reality headset that projects a complete context visualization around its head like a halo. The projection shows a file structure tree on one side, a task checklist with some items glowing green (complete) and others white (pending), and agent notes floating like post-its. The robot's posture conveys focused concentration. The environment is a clean, modern pod-like workspace with soft ambient lighting. Portrait composition, modern tech illustration style, calming blue and white palette with accent colors for the projected elements.

**Caption:** *The Deep Work session: Agents enter with a comprehensive context package—fully oriented before writing a single line of code.*

## Image 6: The Cortex Orchestrator

**Prompt:**
Create an image of a stylized mechanical beehive viewed from above, with a glowing central core representing the Cortex engine. Hexagonal cells extend outward, each containing a miniature project icon or document. Glowing neural pathways connect the cells, with some paths highlighted in green (completed dependencies) and others in amber (blocked). Small bee-like drones with digital displays for faces patrol the pathways, carrying status updates. The scene has a warm honey-gold color scheme with technological overlay, mixing organic beehive shapes with circuit board patterns. Bird's eye view, symmetrical composition, detailed illustration style.

**Caption:** *The Cortex orchestrator maintains system-wide oversight—analyzing dependencies, detecting cycles, and coordinating without executing code.*

## Image 7: Vendor Agnostic Operation

**Prompt:**
Create an image showing a central luminous markdown document icon floating above an open palm, with five different stylized AI robot figures arranged in a circle around it. Each robot has distinctly different design aesthetics representing different AI providers—one sleek and minimal, one industrial and robust, one organic and flowing, one geometric and angular, one playful and rounded. They are all connected to the central document by gentle light beams of different colors. Above the scene, a human hand reaches down to touch the document, showing equal access. Clean white background, modern logo-style illustration, vibrant but harmonious multi-color palette.

**Caption:** *Vendor-agnostic by design: The same AGENCY.md file works with Claude, GPT-4, Grok, Gemini—or a human with a text editor.*

## Image 8: Building the Operating System for Agents

**Prompt:**
Create an image of a layered architectural diagram rendered as a beautiful 3D floating structure. The base layer shows "AGENCY.md" as glowing file icons forming a foundation. The middle layer shows "Cortex" as an interconnected mesh of processing nodes. The top layer shows "Deep Work Sessions" as pod-like chambers where robot figures work. All layers are connected by flowing data streams visualized as luminous ribbons. The structure floats above a subtle grid representing version control. Isometric technical illustration style, blueprint-inspired aesthetic with deep blue background and glowing cyan, orange, and white elements. Detailed and clean.

**Caption:** *Agent Hive as an operating system: AGENCY.md files are our "files," Cortex is our "scheduler," and Deep Work sessions are our "processes."*

## Generation Notes

**Style consistency:** All images should maintain a cohesive visual language—futuristic but approachable, technical but not cold, using consistent robot/AI representations and color palettes.

**Aspect ratios:**
- Hero image (1): 16:9 landscape for article header
- Technical illustrations (2, 6, 8): 4:3 or 1:1 for inline figures
- Conceptual illustrations (3, 4, 5, 7): 16:9 or 4:3 depending on content

**Quality modifiers to include:** high-quality, detailed, professional illustration, clean lines, modern aesthetic
